Session variables:
    user_id     the id of the user who is logged in
    applicant   true iff the logged-in user is an applicant
    recruiter   true iff the logged-in user is a recruiter
    admin       true iff the logged-in user is an administrator

Architecture notes:
    Each page imports lib.php, which includes functions.php
    and db.php, and does some initial setup (connects to the
    database, starts the session).
